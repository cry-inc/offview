OffView
=======

OffView is a simple tool for viewing OFF files with OpenGL.
It's based on the Qt library and is written in C++.

The OFF file format is a simple format to store 3D objects as polygon meshes.
OffView uses Qt for the GUI and OpenGL as 3D API to draw the objects.

This software was originally written by a group of four students in the context
of a graded software project at the University of Applied Sciences in Constance. 

The project was located at http://code.google.com/p/offview/, but since Google
Code will be turned off, this project was moved to GitHub at
https://github.com/cry-inc/offview.


How to build OffView from source code
=====================================

Windows:

  - Install the Qt Creator with version 4.6 or greater
  - Open the OffView project file (offview.pro)
  - Set the build configuration to 'Release'
  - Build it
  - The binary should be now in your OffView/release folder
  
  If you plan to use OffView on other Windows machines do not forget to provide
  the necessary Qt DLL files! Those are mingwm10.dll, QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll
  and QtOpenGL4.dll located in your Qt/qt/bin/ folder.
  
  If you do not want to distribute the QT DLLs with OffView you have to link
  OffView statically! The required step are describe here:
  http://qt.nokia.com/doc/deployment-windows.html#static-linking
  
  This still requires the compiler specific DLLs, for example mingwm10.dll,
  if you use MingW for compiling. For more information see here:
  http://qt.nokia.com/doc/deployment-windows.html#application-dependencies

Linux:
	
  - Install Qt >= 4.6
  - Open a terminal window
  - cd /directory/with/offview-source
  - Type 'qmake -config release'
  - Type 'make'
  - You should now see a binary called "offview" in the current folder

Mac OS X:

  Volunteers required :)

  
How to update the translation files
===================================

1. Open a terminal an change the directory to the OffView source folder
2. Run 'lupdate offview.pro' to extract and update all strings
3. Edit the translation files (lang/offview_*.ts) with Qt Linguist
4. Run 'lrelease offview.pro' to build the compressed translation files
5. Rebuild OffView. That's necessary because the translations are embedded
   in the OffView binary!


How to add a new translation
============================

1. Add the new translation to the file offview.pro. See the TRANSLATIONS variable.
   Example: 'TRANSLATIONS += lang/offview_<xy>.ts'
2. Open a terminal an change the directory to the OffView source folder
3. Run 'lupdate offview.pro' to create the new translation file
4. Copy a language icon with the size of 16 x 11 pixels into img/menu/
5. Add the icon to the resource file offview.qrc
6. Translate the translation file (lang/offview_<xy>.ts) with Qt Linguist.
   There are two items which must be translated, all other items are optional:
   MainWindow::LanguageMenuItem (Should contain the native name of the language)
   MainWindow::LanguageMenuIcon (Should contain the name of the language icon file)
7. Run 'lrelease offview.pro' to build the compressed translation file
8. Add the file lang/offview_<xy>.qm to the resource file offview.qrc
9. Rebuild OffView. That's necessary because the translations and icons are embedded
   in the OffView binary!
